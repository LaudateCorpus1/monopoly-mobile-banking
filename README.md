## A cloud-based monopoly mobile banking app.

This app replaces the play money of every Monopoly board game. Every player can see his money balance on his phone and make transactions through the app easily.

A demo is available on [monopoly-banking.web.app](https://monopoly-banking.web.app/).

How to use this app:
1. All players have to open the website (or install the app on their phone).
2. One player creates a new game.
3. All players connect to this game.
4. Now all transactions can be done via the app, e.g. sending a player money or getting money from the bank.
5. Have fun ðŸ˜€

NOTE: This project is still in early stages. If you have ideas, find bugs or have suggestions just [open an issue](https://github.com/devj3ns/monopoly-banking/issues/new) :).
