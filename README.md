## A cloud-based monopoly banking app.

This app replaces the play money of every Monopoly board game. Every player can see his balance on his phone and send and receive money through the app easily.

A demo is available on [monopoly-banking.web.app](https://monopoly-banking.web.app/).

How to use this app:
1. All players have to install the app on their phone.
2. One player creates a new game/lobby.
3. All players connect to this game/lobby.
4. Now all transactions can be done via the app, e.g. sending a player money or getting money from the bank.
5. Have fun ðŸ˜€

NOTE: This project is still in early stages.
